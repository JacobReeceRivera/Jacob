    The first thing that comes to mind when you think of a burger is the classic hamburger<br>
    It’s made from
    <ul>
        <em>ground beef <br>
            onions <br>
            and a special sauce<br></em>
    </ul>
    The cheeseburger is another type of burger that has been around for many years.<br>
    It’s made with cheese, which gives it a different taste than the traditional hamburger.
<br>
<br>
There are so many different types of burgers out there today.<br>
There are 
<ul>
    <em>veggie burgers<br>
        turkey burgers<br>
        and even fish burgers!<br></em>
</ul>
There are also specialty burgers like the Philly cheesesteak burger or even the bacon double cheeseburger!<br>
There are also other foods that go well with burgers such as french fries or onion rings.<br>
You can make any kind of burger you want by just changing up some ingredients here and there!</p>
